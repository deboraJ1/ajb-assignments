FUCNTIONALITY

Instead of dnaInputField.setText("Enter your DNA sequence here."); , you should use
dnaInputField.setPromptText("Enter your DNA sequence here.");

I like the extra functionality that you implemented, with the error messages and listeners on checkboxes,
I don't like that the inputField is cleared when clicked, though. :) It makes it impossible to make changes to the sequences.

DESIGN

please code to the interface when possible, this allows you to later change the implementation if necessary. for example:
ArrayList<Character> validNucleotides = generateValidNucleotides();
can be
List<Character> validNucleotides = generateValidNucleotides();
and if you need to, you could change it from ArrayList to a LinkedList, for example, at any point.

READABILITY

package names should start with lowercase
that's a very long compareTo method in FourMer. You could simply use Integer.compare()
also the while loop to check validity of k-mers is uncessarily complex, you could simply do kmer.matches("[ATGC]{4}")
    and you actually do this twice, once in setKmer, once in calcHash
all fields of the View class can be final
you could also just extend BorderPane in the KmerView class, and use it as your root. but we're going to use FXML in the future, anyway. :)
please use lambda's when possible. the ChangeListener's are pretty unnecessary, for example.
            this.dnaInputField.focusedProperty().addListener((obsValue, oldValue, newValue) -> {
                //code here
            });
            or:
            checkBox.setOnAction(e -> updateOutputArea());


OVERALL: 10/10
although many remarks, overall it was quite good. thank you!
