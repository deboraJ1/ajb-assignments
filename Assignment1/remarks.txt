FUNCTIONALITY

everything works

DESIGN

for the sake of modularity, I'd move the parts of the code that extracts k-mers, does the actual hash calculations, etc. to different class(es).
FastAFileParser, as the name suggests, should only parse a fasta file and return its contents.
Please try to adhere to the OOP concepts better in the future assignments.

READABILITY

instead of separating words with an underscore, we use camelCase in Java (e.g. not dna_seq_reading, but dnaSeqReading, even better isReadingDnaSeq since it's a boolean).
