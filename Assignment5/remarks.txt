FUNCTIONALITY

Angular drawing is broken
Presenter line 160: that's a directory on your computer, so doesn't work for me. :)

DESING

Group in presenter is actually a view element
all fields in the model (e.g. edges), could also be JavaFX properties, that way you could directly bind to them instead of updating the text field manually each time a tree is parsed.

regarding static's, I don't actually have anything to add on top of my email. I like your design better. :)

READABILITY

never leave catch statements empty!!!
    line 26 in AbstractWindow throws an exception for me (had to with paths...), but since the catch statement is empty, it took me ~5 minutes to find why the program terminates with a weird error.

POINTS: 19/20
